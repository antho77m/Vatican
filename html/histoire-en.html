    <aside>
        In 754, the pontifical states are created and it is the pope who directs them after the donation of its ground by the king of the francs Pepin to thank the pope Zacharie to have legitimize the overthrow of the Merovingians (dynasty reigning of the 5th century in the middle of the 7th century) and thus gave the pontifical states (mainly of the poor grounds and the marshes)
        <br><br>
        In 1870, the pontifical states are conquered by the kingdom of Italy and the pope pius 9 takes refuge then in the city of the vatican and it is in 1929 that the agreements of Latran are signed and that Italy recognizes the existence of the Vatican in exchange of the attachment of the pontifical states to Italy (to know more)
        <br>
        The Vatican was created on February 11, 1929
        <br><br>
        In the Vatican, the Pope has all the powers, but two of the three powers (executive, legislative and judicial) are delegated. The governor has the executive power, while the legislative power is delegated to a commission of 5 to 7 cardinals. The pope is elected by a qualified majority (at least two-thirds of the votes) in a ceremony called conclave.
